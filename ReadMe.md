KengoBot, or Kengo Bot, is the spiritual successor to the other Discord based alternatives, and makes an effort to rectify some of Discord's own internal issues through leveraging their API to include additional features, featuring server backups / rollbacks, server safe mode, extensive tracking, extensive streaming, machine learning integrated warning system(s) for moderation, and more.

The project will, for the moment, remain closed-source.
